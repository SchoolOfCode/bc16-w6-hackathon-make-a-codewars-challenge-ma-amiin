/**
 * Hello challenger! You're a teacher at a school and you've notice that not all the names on the school register have been capitalised. 
 *  Your task is to write a function named `capitaliseNames` which takes in an array and returns back the array but with all the non-capitalised words having been capitalised
 *
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `transformLength([ben, Henry, Harry, mike, jessica, ahmed])` should return [Ben, Henry, Harry, Mike, Jessica, Ahmed] 
 *    `transformLength([Tom, Felix, Sandra, Juan])` should return [Tom, Felix, Sandra, Juan] as they were all already capitalised
 */
export function capitalizeNames(array) {
  //write you code here!!
  }
